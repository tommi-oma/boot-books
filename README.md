# Spring Boot Development - Book store

This repository contains codes for the Spring Boot Development course's
labs. The lab codes are in branches (not ideal, but hopefully easiest).
Most of the branches are solutions for the labs, but some may have a branch
that contains a project in a state that has some of the routines for lab
setup implemented.

The labs
	
1. CRUD Books
1. Error handling / Books
1. REST client for Datamuse / Books
1. Testing the REST
1. Book repository (JPA)
1. Book store (relationships)
1. Transactions
